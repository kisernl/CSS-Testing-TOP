# CSS-Testing-TOP

## Task 1
In this task, there are two boxes below, one is using the standard box model, the other the alternate box model. Change the width of the second box by adding declarations to the .alternate class, so that it matches the visual width of the first box.

## Task 2
In this task, add to the box:

A 5px, black, dotted border.
A top margin of 20px.
A right margin of 1em.
A bottom margin of 40px.
A left margin of 2em.
Padding on all sides of 1em.

## Task 3
In this task, the inline element has a margin, padding and border. However, the lines above and below are overlapping it. What can you add to your CSS to cause the size of the margin, padding, and border to be respected by the other lines, while still keeping the element inline?
